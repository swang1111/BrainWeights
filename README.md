# BrainWeights

A brain teaser app that you can't help but be addicted to!

# Inspiration
We wanted to create an app which would be fun and still be good for people to use, especially the teens of today but was still original. The brain exercises offered in the app stimulate brain activity when compared to the typical apps used today.

# What it does
There are 12 questions, with multiple choice or fill-in answers. Once the answer choice is confirmed by the player, it can be checked. There are also hints available if a question is found hard. The final score is displayed at the end.
